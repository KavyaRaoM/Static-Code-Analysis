# Static-Code-Analysis

This project implements an 8-layer neural network combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and dense layers to classify errors in nearly 120,000 C/C++ programs with 95.2% accuracy.

Encodes 119K+ programs into matrices using static code metrics.

Automatically detects and classifies error types.

Enhances grading efficiency by providing feedback comparable to human instructors.
